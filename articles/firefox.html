        <p>This is how I like to set up Firefox.</p>

        <h2>Pre-Setup 🛠️</h2>
        <p>Download Firefox <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">here</a>. Download different versions
            <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Recommended settings ⚙️</h2>
        <p>✅ - Turn on 🔘 - Personal Preference ❌ - Turn off</p>
        <p><strong>To see configuration, click on a category.</strong></p>

        <h3>🔨 General</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>✅ Default browser check</summary>
            <p>Windows sometimes replaces your default browser with Edge after updating, so checking
                this is a good idea.</p>
        </details>

        <p class='ok'>
            🔘 Switch to tab when you open a link/image/media
        </p>

        <details>
            <summary>✅ Automatic color scheme</summary>
            <p>Automatic color scheme adaptation is useful if you use Auto Dark Mode.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>🔘 Change the default monospace font</summary>
            <p>Change it to your preferred monospace font.</p>
        </details>

        <details class='ok'>
            <summary>🔘 Format language features using your own country language</summary>
            <!--12 hour is better btw-->
            <p>i.e. Australia uses dd/mm/yyyy, metric system and the 12 hour clock.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>✅ Check your spelling as you type</summary>
            <p>Does not connect to the internet.</p>
        </details>

        <details class='ok'>
            <summary>🔘 What should Firefox do with other files?</summary>
            <p>Save files just saves files with no fuss. The other option asks whether to open that file type or
                save that file type.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>✅ Automatically install updates</summary>
            <p>This automatically installs updates for you with no fuss. If you really don't want your browser to
                update to new versions unless you tell it to, you can change it, but not updating your web browser
                exposes you to many security threats.</p>
        </details>

        <details class='ok'>
            <summary>🔘 Use smooth scrolling</summary>
            <p>Turn off on Linux with a NVIDIA GPU. Not worth it.</p>
        </details>

        <details class='ok'>
            <summary>🔘 Control media via keyboard/headset/virtual interface</summary>
            <p>Sometimes hijacks your media keys / takes priority.</p>

        <p>❌ Recommend features as you browse</p>

        <details>
            <summary>❌ Enable DNS over HTTPS</summary>
            <p>Enable this feature system-wide instead. If you can't enable it system-wide due to policies, you can use
                this to get around blocklists.</p>

        <p>❌ Sponsored Shortcuts</p>


        <h3>🔍 Search</h3>


        <details class='ok'>
            <summary>🔘 Address bar or Address Bar + Search Bar</summary>
            <p>Up to personal preference. If you like having a separate search bar you can enable it here. There
                is
                an advanced setting called <code>keyword.enabled</code> in <code>about:config</code> that makes
                the
                address bar unsearchable.</p>
        </details>

                <h3>🔐 Privacy & Security</h3>
            </summary>
            <p>

            <h4>Enhanced Tracking Protection</h4>
            <details>
                <summary>✅ Strict</summary>
                <p>This does not break most websites and only helps to protect security. If you need to turn off
                    tracking protection look at the top left of the address bar. You can turn it off per website
                    there.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>❌ Do Not Track</summary>
                <p>Do Not Track is not what it says. It basically sends a request to every website you visit and the
                    website can choose to honour that request or not. And most of the time, they don't. It's just
                    additional tracking information.</p>
            </details>

            <h4>Cookies and Site Data</h4>
            <details class='ok'>
                <summary>🔘 Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed</summary>
                <p>Cookies are still used to track you, but if you clear cookies then you will need to log-in to
                    every
                    website unless you make exceptions to those websites. It's not really worth it nowadays as
                    websites
                    have much easier methods to track you, like fingerprinting.</p>
            </details>

            <h4>Cookie Banner Reduction</h4>
            <details>
                <summary>✅ Reduce Cookie Banners</summary>
                <p>Firefox automatically rejects cookie requests on sites that show you that "Can i use your
                    cookies".
                    This only helps to improve your privacy.</p>
            </details>

            <h4>Logins and Passwords</h4>
            <details class='ok'>
                <summary>🔘 Ask to save logins and passwords for websites</summary>
                <p>Firefox's inbuilt password manager is secure and encrypted. Mozilla cannot see your passwords.
                    You
                    can learn more about this <a
                        href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-firefox-securely-saves-passwords">here</a>.
                    If
                    you use another password manager, t urn this off</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>✅ Show alerts about passwords for breached websites</summary>
                <p>If you use Firefox's password manager, be sure to turn on this setting. Basically, it checks
                    known
                    website breaches and if the date that you saved a password for your website is before the breach
                    happened, Firefox will tell you to change your password. The breach data is provided by <a
                        href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned</a>, a trustworthy site.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>✅ Use a Primary Password</summary>
                <p>If you use Firefox's password manager, be sure to turn on this setting. This makes it so you need
                    a
                    password to enter your logins so someone on your PC cant access it, like a family member.</p>
            </details>

            <h4>History</h4>
            <details>
                <summary>Read</summary>
                <p>History cannot be accessed by websites. It is simply something that is stored on your pc. Only
                    clear
                    history if you have to hide it from someone.</p>
            </details>

            <h4>Permissions</h4>
            <details>
                <summary>Location, Camera, Microphone, Notifications, Autoplay, Virtual Reality</summary>
                <p>All of these are set to "Always Ask" by default. If you Set these to "Block", you are opening
                    yourself up to device fingerprinting. Keep all of these settings by default.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>✅ Block pop-up windows</summary>
                <p>Some websites like to open popups that are usually malicious. If theres a site that is
                    trustworthy,
                    you can open the popup on that site.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>✅ Warn you when websites try to install add-ons</summary>
                <p>Stops malware sites from installing malicious addons/extensions into your browser.</p>
            </details>

            <h4>Firefox Data Collection and Use</h4>
            <details>
                <summary>Before you turn these off:</summary>
                <p>This is data that gets sent to Mozilla to help improve Firefox. If you use Firefox
                    Beta/Developer/Nightly, leave it on to help Firefox. The data gets used by developers to help
                    develop Firefox. Mozilla does not sell this data to any third-party from what i know. <strong>If
                        you
                        want to help Mozilla develop Firefox, leave it on. If you don't want to send data, turn it
                        off.</strong></p>
            </details>

            <h4>Deceptive Content and Dangerous Software Protection</h4>
            <details>
                <summary>✅ Block dangerous and deceptive content</summary>
                <p>These settings use <strong>Google Safe Browsing</strong> to block malware that Google have listed
                    in
                    their database. If you don't want to connect to Google's servers, leave this off. You have to
                    choose
                    whether you want Privacy or Security.</p>
            </details>

            <h4>Certificates</h4>
            <details>
                <summary>✅ Query OCSP responder servers to confirm the current validity of certificates</summary>
                <p>This is another Security or Privacy scenario. In order to check that a website hasn't been
                    tampered
                    with, Firefox will send data to the certificate authority of that website to check if the site
                    is
                    valid. This means that you will be pinging all CA's constantly.</p>
            </details>

            <h4>HTTPS-Only Mode</h4>
            <details>
                <summary>✅ Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows</summary>
                <p>Literally nearly every site uses HTTPS, and if it doesn't you'll get a warning. HTTP is unsecure
                    and
                    anyone can see what you're doing on that website. With HTTPS, they can only see the domain
                    you're
                    on. i.e. if you're searching on google.com, they can only see you're on google.com. But if
                    you're
                    using the HTTP version, they can see exactly what you searched.</p>
            </details>
            </p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary style="display:inline;">
                <h3>🔁 Sync</h3>
            </summary>
            <p>
                If you have multiple devices then Sign up for a Firefox account. This allows you to sync your
                passwords,
                history, bookmarks and else between devices. Mozilla cannot see any of your data in your account.
            </p>
        </details>



        <details>
            <summary style="display:inline;">
                <h3>⚠️ Advanced (about:config)</h3>
            </summary>
            <p>
            <p>This can help you tweak everything in Firefox but heed the warning Firefox gives you, you can screw
                up
                your browser. You can access this by entering <code>about:config</code> in the address bar. The
                amount
                of customizations you can do to Firefox with about:config tweaks alone is gigantic and I'll only
                show a
                few different user.js files for you to look through.</p>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js">arkenfox user.js</a> - This is a template file that
                hardens Firefox for security, privacy and anti-tracking features. I will reiterate that this is a
                template and it is advised to read the wiki and look through user.js file itself.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/pyllyukko/user.js">pyllyukko user.js</a> - Similar to arkenfox's user.js
                script except it seems that it goes a lot further with browser hardening. Seems overkill but it
                exists
                if you want it.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox">yokoffing Betterfox</a> - Has tweaks to make
                Firefox
                faster, make Firefox minimal and also some privacy/security tweaks.</li>
            <li><a href="https://libreddit.spike.codes/r/firefox/wiki/aboutconfig">r/Firefox about:config tweaks</a>
                - A

                    blocks
                    annoying popups, it blocks various types of tracking and makes your browser way faster.</li>

                        category and check the following:</p>

                <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-firefox-clean">Bypass Paywalls
                        Clean</a> -
                    This has been removed from the Firefox addons store for "copyright" reasons but this bypasses
                    paywalls from websites that require you to pay to see an article.</li>
                <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/skip-redirect/">Skip Redirect</a> - Some
                    sites like to add a tracking referrer before directing you to a website. This disables that.
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/dessant/web-archives">Web Archives</a> - Allows you to view archived
                    and
                    cached versions of a webpage, useful when a certain site is having a mass blackout.</li>
                <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/augmented-steam/">Augmented Steam</a> -
                    Made
                    by IsThereAnyDeal that improves the Steam website with a bunch of useful features.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Extensions to avoid</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/i-dont-care-about-cookies">I Don't Care
                        about Cookies</a> - This was recently acquired by Avast which is known to be scummy. Use <a
                        href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/istilldontcareaboutcookies/">I still
                        don't
                        care about cookies</a>, an open source continuation of the former.</li>
                <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/">Privacy Badger</a> -
                    This
                    extension is practically useless as it "learns" to block trackers. So it doesn't block them all
                    until its "learnt" it. uBlock Origin blocks these by default.</li>
                <li>HTTPS Everywhere - Redundant with HTTPS Only Mode. This extension was removed from the store but
                    do
                    not bother with any other HTTPS addons.</li>
                <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/">Decentraleyes</a>/<a
                        href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/localcdn-fork-of-decentraleyes/">LocalCDN</a>
                    - if you use Strict tracking protection, third party sites are already partitioned and
                    isolated.If
                    you care about not connecting to certain CDN domains, use a VPN or TOR instead.</li>
                <li>Any other adblockers (<a
                        href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-for-firefox/">AdBlock</a>/<a
                        href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/">AdBlock Plus</a>) -
                    uBlock
                    Origin is already the best adblocker and a lot of these don't have the features uBlock Origin
                    enables. Some of these extensions can also be malware.</li>
                <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls/">ClearURLs</a> - if you
                    set-up
                    URL tracking protection in uBlock Origin, this extension is redundant.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

        <h2>Other</h2>
        <p>Other things to look into are <a href="https://github.com/black7375/Firefox-UI-Fix">Firefox UI Fix</a> if
            you
            want a new GUI or want to revert back to the Photon GUI (read the Wiki for further customization), or
            look
            into the <a href="https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme">Firefox Gnome Theme</a> if you
            use
            GNOME and want to make Firefox look like a GTK4 application. You can also look at <a
                href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/themes/">installing new themes</a>.</p>
        <p>If you need a hardened browser or do not want to set up a hardened Firefox I recommend either using TOR
            Browser or Librewolf. If you want a chromium browser, I recommend Vivaldi, Ungoogled Chromium or
            Iridium.
