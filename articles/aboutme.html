    <p>Hello! I am <b>geck</b> (I also go by <i>geckro/geckronome</i> online), and I'm just another person on the web. I go by he/him, but they/them is also fine. I live in Australia :D</p>
    <p>I write this site as a hobby of mine and it's a good way to just get stuff off the mind and have an excuse to do a mini-project.</p>

    <h2>Things I enjoy doing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Software development in Python</li>
      <li>Web development with pure HTML/CSS (no ssgs or fancy frameworks)</li>
      <li>Networking</li>
      <li>Learning new things about anything related to IT</li>
      <li>Poking around in systems</li>
      <li>Playing video games (my favourite genre is 2d metroidvanias!)</li>
      <li>Going for random walks outside in nature</li>
      <li>Cooking meals without following any recipe</li>
      <li>More that I am not remembering as of the time I am writing this</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Computer hardware</h2>
    <p>I'm not going to act like I'm really savvy with hardware, because I'm not. I just picked the parts and let someone else build it for me in 2020.</p>

      <li>CPU: Ryzen 7 3700x</li>

      <li>RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 4x8GiB 3200MHz</li>

    </ul>
    <p>I also bought a Pixel 7a recently to replace my old Oppo Reno2z (Completely worth the upgrade, no complaints with this new device), and also own a pair of Pixel Buds Pro when they were half off.</p>
    <p>I also own a Wii</p>

    <h2>Certifications</h2>

    <p>I don't really have many official certifications, but this is what i've studied for and gotten so far. No links :(</p>
    <p>I think in the future I'll look for a sysadmin-type job.</p>
