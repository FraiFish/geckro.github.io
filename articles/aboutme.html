          <p>Hello! I am <b>geck</b> (I also go by <i>geckro/geckronome</i> online), and I'm just another person on the web. I go by he/him, but they/them is also fine. I live in Australia :D</p>
          <p>I write this site as a hobby of mine and it's a good way to just get stuff off the mind and have an excuse to do a mini-project.</p>

          <h2>Computer hardware</h2>

          <p>I'm not going to act like I'm really savvy with hardware, because I'm not. I just picked the parts and let someone else build it for me in 2020.</p>

            <li><b>CPU</b>: Ryzen 7 3700x</li>
            <li><b>GPU</b>: RTX 2060 Super</li>
            <li><b>RAM</b>: Corsair Vengeance LPX 4x8GiB 3200MHz</li>
            <li><b>CASE</b>: Corsair Carbide 275R</li>
            <li><b>SSD</b>: Samsung 970 EVO Plus 500GiB</li>

          </ul>
          <p>I also bought a Pixel 7a recently to replace my old Oppo Reno2z (Completely worth the upgrade, no complaints with this new device), and also own a pair of Pixel Buds Pro when they were half off.</p>
          <p>I also own a Wii, 3DS and Switch. I do not use them that often anymore (❤️ emulators)</p>
