            <p>I tend to switch between GNOME and KDE and right now I am using GNOME and I want to write about the features and things in GNOME that I find frustrating.</p>
            <p>For this post I am using Fedora 38 Beta and GNOME 44. I am not using stock GNOME and I have tweaked settings and installed various extensions. Keep in mind I am not a GNOME developer and I have no idea how GNOME development works. I am just judging (ranting) this as a pesky end user.</p>
            <p>Also, this is not things that are wrong with GNOME. GNOME has a <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/hig/principles.html">very different philosophy</a> when it comes to their ecosystem which makes a lot of stuff I talk about redudant as that is not their philosophy.</p>
            <p>GNOME seems like the way they operate is "their way only" and if you used to use something and they remove it for philosophical reasons and you can't add it back. I don't like that, and that's the mindset I have.</p>

            <h2>Files (Nautilus)</h2>

            <p>There are some features in Files which are noticeably absent which annoys me. Firstly, you cannot add a new document or file in the context menu, you can only create new folders. The fix to this is having to go into <code>~/Templates</code> but that is not obvious at all and there should be at least be a file called "empty.txt" or similiar in the context menu by default.</p>
            <p>There is also no Split View mode like what Dolphin offers, but Explorer on Windows 11 doesn't offer that either. You can't right-click a file and open the folder with a program but you need to go inside the folder itself, then right-click on blank space and click on "Open With".</p>
            <p>There is also no refresh at all in nautilus from what i can find. You have to know that "F5" or "Ctrl+R" refreshes which isn't exactly clear beforehand.</p>
            <p>I tend to use list views as I cannot get used to grid views but the columns in list views is to little information for me, but you can change it by changing "Visible Columns". But that only applies to that specific folder and not nautilus itself. So if you want to always see the filetype, too bad?</p>
            <p>But other than that nautilus is fine. It just works.</p>

            <h2>GNOME Console</h2>
            <p><em>This is not the old GNOME Terminal using GTK3. This is <a href="https://apps.gnome.org/app/org.gnome.Console/">GNOME Console</a>, the new one using GTK4/Libadwaita.</em></p>
            <p>The GNOME Console is very different, and has little or no options at all to customize a terminal emulator. The only things you can customize are whether you want it to use a system/light/dark theme, what zoom level you want and.. thats it. Nothing else. The old GTK3 Terminal application had way more features and even then, it was lacking a bit compared to other apps, but Console is infuriating.</p>
            <p>You can't change the transparency which is helpful if you need to see text under the terminal. You can't change the color scheme (ok, which makes sense because of libadwaita). You cannot change the font at all, so you're stuck with the default monospace font which does not look good in the slightest and isn't the most legible to me. You can't change the cursor to a line, you're stuck with a block cursor.</p>
            <p>You also cannot have a split view at all.</p>

            <h2>Settings</h2>

            <p>Mostly, the settings menu is alright. It works and it's easy to navigate, unlike the KDE settings menu where there's a huge amount of settings.</p>

            <p>But there's some issues I have with it. Firstly, there's no opton to snap to corners, to make it so you can't have 4 applications onscreen at once in 4 corners, and I cannot find an extension that does this for GNOME 44.</p>
            <p>Fractional scaling does not exist in GNOME unless you manually turn it on with a specific command that I can't remember. Only options are 100%, 200% and 300%.</p>
            <p>For default applications, you can't change the default app per filetype here, and you can't change the default terminal here either for some reason.</p>
            <p>There doesn't seem to be an option to change the sound step from 5%(?) to something like 1%. You can't tweak anything when it comes to appearance and theming unless you install the GNOME tweak tool.</p>

            <h2>Libadwaita</h2>

            <p>I do like what libadwaita does, but I wish they added some colors like making the light mode less white and more blue, or making the dark mode black. But using the extension Night Theme Switcher makes switching between the two seamless and has the best implementation that I have seen and having this extension in GNOME by default would be very cool, but not needed.</p>

            <h2>Text Editor</h2>

            <p><em>This is not gedit using GTK3. This is GNOME Text Editor, the new one using GTK4/Libadwaita.</em></p>

            <p>GNOME Text Editor is great for opening a file, editing it and then closing it, and the customizability options aren't awful and I commend the devs for that, thank you. But I dont think there's an explorer/folder view, and it seems like there's no support for plugins like what gedit had.</p>

            <h2>Other stuff</h2>

            <p>You need the GNOME tweak tool to add back minimize and maximize buttons. Now I tend to not add maximize buttons because I always drag the window to the top and maximize it that way, but I always minimize the window with the button and never do it with a keyboard shortcut.</p>

            <h2>What GNOME does right</h2>

            <p>It used to be really unstable like a year or two ago, but I tend to find GNOME now the most stable environment. It never crashes with my NVIDIA card and even Windows 11's DE crashes more for me than what GNOME does.</p>
            <p>As of Libadwaita, everything is really pretty and works just fine. Animations are put everywhere and are beautiful (which can lag sometimes, but probably the NVIDIA card).</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

            <p>Maybe I've just gotten too used to a Windows/KDE like interface.</p>
