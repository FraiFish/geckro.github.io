        <h2><a href="#fangame-and-rom-hack-definition">What is a fan game and ROM hack?</a></h2>

        <p>
          A <i>fan game</i> is a completely original game (or a remake) that is created by fans of a franchise, series or particular official game. A <i>ROM hack</i> (or ROM patch) is modifying a game to alter the contents of that game's data and content. Technically a ROM hack can be considered a
          fan-game, but I'll exclude it for this.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="#rom-hacks">ROM Hacks</a></h2>

        <h3><a href="#rom_translation-hacks">Translation hacks</a></h3>

        <p>A <i>translation hack</i> is when you take a ROM and translate the game into another language. This has made many Japanese-only games playable in English. Some examples are:</p>
        <div class="game-area">
          <div class="top-row-area">
            <p class="game-title">Mother 3</p>
            <img src="/img/articles/fangames/mother3.png" />
          </div>
          <p class="game-text">
            The sequel to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EarthBound</a>, <i>Mother 3</i> was originally a Japanese-only game released on the Game Boy Advance. It was originally meant to release to other countries but due to numerous legal and IP
            issues, it was not possible. This game is the most popular example of a translation hack, and has it's own website <a href="https://mother3.fobby.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Without this translation hack, no one would know or care about the Mother series, and would
            just be remembered as that one quirky RPG for the SNES.
          </p>
          <p class="game-text">Nintendo has re-released this game on the respective virtual consoles, but it has been in Japan only. This translation hack is probably the most popular, and most people have heard of Mother 3 because of it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-area">
          <div class="top-row-area">
            <p class="game-title">Captain Rainbow</p>
            <img src="/img/articles/fangames/captainrainbow.png" />
          </div>
          <p class="game-text">
            A one-off game by the Chibi-Robo developers, <i>Captain Rainbow</i> is a Wii game that released only in Japan. There is an in-progress translation hack <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=36068.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (these things take time!)
          </p>
          <p class="game-text">The game flopped hard financially but thanks to the ongoing translations, people can still experience this weird and "interesting" adventure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-area">
          <div class="top-row-area">
            <p class="game-title">Trials of Mana (Seiken Densetsu 3)</p>
            <img src="/img/articles/fangames/trialsofmana.png" />
          </div>
          <p class="game-text">
            An indirect sequel to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Mana" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secret of Mana</a>, <i>Trials of Mana</i> was a Japanese-only game released on the Super Nintendo, and is considered one of the greatest games of all time. It was not localized for
            the longest time until fans made a translation hack <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/translations/440/">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="game-text">A rare case of games actually being officially localized, this got an official translation in 2019 in the Collection of Mana which fans ripped immediately, and even got a (pretty bad) remake also called "Trials of Mana" in 2020.</p>
        </div>

        <h3><a href="#rom_content-hacks">Content hacks</a></h3>

        <p>A content hack is ROM hacks, using the original game as a base to make whatever the creator wants.</p>

        <div class="game-area">
          <div class="top-row-area">
            <p class="game-title">Super Mario Star Road</p>
            <img src="/img/articles/fangames/supermariostarroad.png" />
          </div>
          <p class="game-text">
            A ROM Hack to Super Mario 64, and it is most probably the most recognizable Super Mario 64 ROM hack out there. It released in 2011 by Skelux and has all new levels, new music, new hub and new everything and 130 new stars to collect. You can view it

            <p class="game-title">Relics of the Past</p>
            <img src="/img/articles/fangames/relicsofthepast.png" />
          </div>
          <p class="game-text">
            A ROM Hack to Breath of the Wild, it tries to make the game much harder, almost kaizo like. It boasts itself on not just buffing enemies like a lot of hacks, and actually makes modifications to the world (but it still uses the original world, a custom world would be an insane amount of
            work). You can look at the website <a href="https://relicsofthepast.dev/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="game-text">I wanted to show this example because there are multiple recent, modern games that also get ROM hacks. The scene is not just limited to old consoles.</p>

          <p class="game-text">
            A ROM Hack to Pokemon FireRed/LeafGreen. This is considered to be one of the best Pokemon ROM hacks (there are many out there) and some say that it is better than actual official games. Just because it is based on a GBA game, it does not mean it is crude, as it is filled to the brim with
            custom code and content. Forum post <a href="https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-unbound-completed.382178/">here</a>.
