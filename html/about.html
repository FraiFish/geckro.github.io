            <p>My name is <strong>geckro</strong>, and am also known as other titles online like geckronome. I am a student in Western Australia that likes computer stuff such as free and open source software, networking, security, emulation and more. This site isn't really anything special and is more of a passion project but I hope you enjoy it :). Pronouns are <em>he/him</em>.</p>

            <p>Here's a few little personal details about me:</p>

            <p>I don't really have a favourite game but I think the ones that are tied for me are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Knight">Hollow Knight</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraria">Terraria</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_Wii">Mario Kart Wii</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_(video_game)">Celeste</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_0">Yakuza 0</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Unleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantae:_Half-Genie_Hero">Shantae: Half-Genie Hero</a>. My favourite game genre has to be Metroidvanias.</p>
            <p>I tend to talk a lot about emulation and have a lot of knowledge about it but I never really actually play any games. I like watching shows and i'll have to say my favourite one is either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania_(TV_series)">Castlevania (TV Series)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lagoon_(TV_series)">Black Lagoon</a>. I tend to watch everything dubbed as I like to watch the action and not read subtitles.</p>
            <p>I haven't watched many movies at all but I plan on changing that soon enough. Can't think of any recommendation that I like. Same story with books. Other than computers and entertainment I don't really tend to have any other explicit hobbies besides enjoying cooking and gardening.</p>

            <p>Rule of thumb, if I'm on GNOME, I usually use GTK apps. If I'm on KDE, I use QT apps. If i'm on Windows it turns into a warzone.</p>
